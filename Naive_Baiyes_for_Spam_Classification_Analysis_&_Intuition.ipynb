The equation is the amount of people hit by lightning strikes / total amount of lightning strikes (240.000 / 350 MM) ~ 0.07%.\n",

The answer for our problem is 1 / 4 ~ 25%, because we have 2x 50% of chances (50% / 2). Likewise, If you establish a confusion matrix, you will see that heads / heads is only one change in four. Matematically, multiply the probability of getting heads by itself! p(A) x p(B) \n",

        "**Important**: Each time you toss a dice or flip a coin you will have the same probability! Imagine the following situation; you fliped a coin twice and both times you got head. What is the probability to get head again? 50%! The probability are independent by itself!\n",
